Settings.wtf is a decentralized application that allows users to mint their own non-fungible tokens (NFTs). These NFTs are files that contain settings defined by the user, which can then be activated on their browser. The decentralized nature of the app ensures that users have control over their NFTs and the ability to use them across multiple platforms.
